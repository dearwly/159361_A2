# Asset meta files should only be ignored when the asset is likelihood to be changed by the user in the editor.
# For example, models ".fbx" files may be customized by the user and the associated meta file should be committed.
# However, ".cs" files are generated from script templates and the associated meta file should be ignored.
#
# Uncomment this line if you want to ignore all .meta files.
